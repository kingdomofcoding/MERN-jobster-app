Goal:Assigned
Completed: ?

inline-size: 150px;
overflow-wrap: break-word;
Problem: when i assign the password and its long, the line runs out its frame. so i found this on...
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_text/Wrapping_breaking_text

my fix: 
.item {
  color: white;
  width: 200px;
  min-height: 45px;
  height: auto;
  background: gray;
  border-radius: 1rem;
  margin-bottom: 0.5rem;
  padding: 0.5rem;
  display: flex;
  justify-content: space-between;
  align-items: center;
  cursor: pointer;
  word-wrap: break-word; /* Allows long words to be broken and wrap to the next line */
  overflow-wrap: break-word; /* Ensures long words are broken */
  white-space: normal; /* Allows text to wrap to the next line */
}

.item span {
  display: block;
  width: 80%;
}

.item-child-1 {
  flex-basis: 80%;
}
.item-child-2 {
  flex-basis: 15%;
}

solution: making the spans inside the div which were having problems block elements and second problem was the layout of spans, so i added flex-basis.

Goal: Complete the crud operations, setup the database for crud operations, and fix the crud operations in frontend. Also fix the item(credential) field CSS. Also only delete the ones that are checked.
Goal Completed: Not Yet.

History: 
#1 Problem: when i delete 5/5 items 1 is left over. 
Solution:apparently if had this   setPageMessages((pre) => messages.slice(start, end)); in an if statement, after I deleted the if statement, it works.

?Goal Completed?: crud operations are completed, now i need to setup the full crud operations for today, both frontend and backend. 
?What Not Done?: I still need to fix item(credential) CSS.

New related Goal: save crud operations to database.

Goal:Implement the perfect menu
- I am so excited to do this. I love the menu project very much. I am going to study this whenever I can, like study it really good and plus ill learn to study.

When you set height: auto; in CSS, the element's height will adjust to fit the content inside it. This means that the height will be determined by the content within the element, rather than being explicitly set by you.

when i say height: 0 - the element's height collapses to , making it invisible or hidden in terms of vertical space.The element will not be rendered visibly on the screen, and it will not take up any vertical space in the layout.

overflow:hidden, although the height collapses of the container, the elements in it are still visible, so we need overflow:hidden to hide it. and thats it. 

than we need height auto to bring the element back to view

Problem: How to css overlapping bars between content videos.

  align-items: center; /* Center items vertically */
  justify-content: center; /* Center items horizontally */
  color: white; /* White text color */
  font-size: 1.2em; /* Increase the font size */

Goal: the many different ones look ugly so just choose the biggest one and increase the size of rest of them to the biggest one, the inputs and labels.
---
Task:Study this code in Form. The useEffect and css label and input
---
Goal:also make responsive the inputs and labels
Problem: when responsive 1 is bigger, so we want to calculate the width of label and width of input and 
label + input 

offsetWidth gives us the total width of the element.

input.style.setProperty("--label-width", `${labelWidth}px`)
this is an inline style

so what i think about it: we figure out the width of each label.
--!!!-- create a local variable...
--2-- we set a new custom property on input: this custom property is a variable holding the width of the label.
--3-- we use css to make padding-left bigger with the css variable
